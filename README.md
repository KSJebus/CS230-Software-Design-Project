# CS230-Software-Design-Project
## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client who wanted to develop a web-based application version of "Draw It or Lose It," a drawing guessing game inspired by "Win, Lose or Draw." They required a scalable, real-time multiplayer gaming platform with 60-second rounds, 30-second progressive image rendering, cross-platform compatibility, and secure distributed architecture.
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided comprehensive platform analysis covering all operating systems, gave well-reasoned recommendations for each technical component with cost-benefit considerations, maintained consistent focus on security throughout, and created structured evaluation tables that systematically compared options against specific criteria.
## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process forced systematic evaluation of each platform option rather than making assumptions, identified critical technical constraints early, provided a clear decision-making framework through structured comparisons, and established a solid architectural foundation with the domain model.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the System Architecture View section. Since we did not need to write anything here, I would add specific architectural diagrams, detailed technology stack recommendations, technical specifications for the microservices architecture, database design considerations, and performance metrics.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted needs through real-time multiplayer requirements (implemented via WebSocket connections), cross-platform accessibility (addressed through web-based architecture), scalability needs (met through microservices and cloud solutions), and security concerns (implemented through role-based authorization). Considering user needs is crucial to ensure the software solves the intended problem and provides good user experience.
## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used systematic platform evaluation against consistent criteria, constraint-driven design starting with technical/business limitations, modular microservices architecture, and security-first integration. Future strategies would include user journey mapping, early prototyping, performance modeling, formal risk assessment, iterative validation with user testing, and detailed technology evaluation matrices.
